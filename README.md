Jupyter (Python) Notebooks
=========

Here is compilation of notebooks I used for work, learning, testing ideas or having fun.

### Geophysics
#### Numerical Modeling with Finite Differences  

**Cool animations inside :-D**

 1. [Heat Difusion Equation 2D Explicit Finite Differences ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/Heat%20Diffusion%202D.ipynb) toy example

 2. [Explicit Finite Differences Scalar Wave Equation with Absorbing Boundaries (4th order space 2nd time)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/Explicit%20Scalar%20Wave%202D.ipynb)

 3. [Modeling Synthetic Reflection Seismic Survey for Geological Toy Model](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/Synthetic_Shots_Simple_Acquisition_Pattern.ipynb)

 4. [Explicit Finite Differences Reverse Time Migration ](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/RTM%20Zero%20Offset.ipynb) for (Pos-stack) Zero-Offset Sections acoustic (4th order space 2nd time) toy example. Forward and reverse modeling is done.

 5. [Analytic Solution for Scalar Wave Equation 2D](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/Explicit%20Scalar%20Wave%202D%20and%20Analytic%20Solution.ipynb) based on Alford 1974 paper for evaluating accuracy of explicit finite diferences wave solution

 6. [Anisotropic Elastic Wave Equation Staggered Grid 2D](
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/master/blob/master/Explicit%20Elastic%20Wave%202D%20-%20Staggered%20Grid.ipynb) Needs a small fix: the last animation is not for pressure field but for particle velocity in x direction.  

More cool geophysics [here](http://numericalearth.blogspot.com.br/).  

Unfortunately some of the code above has not been translated from Portuguese.

### Hobby Financial Market

#### Machine Learning

 1. [Shortest Pytorch example (1 hidden layer NN) Learning A Logical XOR Operator](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eusoubrasileiro/notebooks/blob/master/general/Pytorch%20Learning%20XOR%20Example.ipynb)

** To Do / To Finish **

-   [ ] New CV and link for download.
-   [x] Remove notebooks from this repo tha are from master.
-   [ ] Make public (bring to here) part of code (many things are too private) and documents  in stocks repo.
